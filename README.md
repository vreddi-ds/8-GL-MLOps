The ML lifecycle is a cyclable process in data science that an organization uses to generate meaningful data.

Data Ingestion (Pre-Processing and Cleaning): It involves data cleaning, data transformation, and data reduction.

Feature Engineering: It is a machine learning pre-processing step that extracts features from raw data. 

Train: It is the process of feeding a machine learning algorithm enough data to learn the pattern. 

Deploy: It is the process of deploying a finished machine learning model in a live environment so that it can be used for its intended purpose.

Test: It is the process of evaluating the performance of a fully trained model on a testing set. 

Tune: It is the process of determining the best set of hyperparameter values for a learning algorithm and then applying that optimized algorithm to any data set.

Model Monitor: Model Monitoring is a stage in the machine learning lifecycle that occurs after model deployment. It entails constantly monitoring your machine learning models for changes such as model degradation, data drift, and concept drift, and ensuring that your model is performing at an acceptable level.
